Audrey Wong's User Manual - Communicating with me

## What are your primary goals as a human being?
- To be of service.
- To explore, play, learn, evolve and create. 
- To see a bear! üêª

## What do you want us to know about your communication style?
I tend to be quiet and prefer to listen when I'm in groups. I open up more in 1:1s. I don't always have an opinion in the moment, but give me time to consider the question and I'll come back with a thoughtful response. 

## What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?
- I like to go down rabbit holes and tinker and explore on my own before reaching out with questions or asking for help.
- I'm highly introverted and need quiet time alone to recharge after being around people or back-to-back meetings.
- I'm happiest when I have good solid chunks of time to focus and work.
- I'm not good with firehose style type of learning. I do best when given bite-size chunks of information, then space and time to explore on my own.
- I like to start the day working on projects and I'm most productive in the afternoons and end-of-day.

## How can you best work with me?
- When possible, allow me time to consider questions in advance of meetings.
- I'm a terrible multi-tasker so I may not be able to read or respond to chats or Slack when I'm in meetings.
- Let me know when I make mistakes and when I do well.
- It's okay to schedule meetings or Slack me during my Focus time.

## What are your pet peeves?
- Being late.
- Mean, rude people.

## What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?
- I tend to sell myself short (I'm working on this).
- It can be difficult for me to ask for help, but I'm getting better at it.
